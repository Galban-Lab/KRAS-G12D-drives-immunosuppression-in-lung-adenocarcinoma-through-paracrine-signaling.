This repository includes code used for data processing and visualization of single cell RNA sequencing data from the manuscript â€œKRAS G12D drives immunosuppression in lung adenocarcinoma through paracrine signaling." This R script will generate the following figures: Figure 2A-B, 2D-G, S2A-C, 3D-F, S3B-E, 4C-G, S4E, 7A, 7C-F, S7A. Raw data files for the novel dataset generated in this manuscript are available through the NIH Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), accession number GSE281744. The Human dataset was downloaded from GSE136246 (Maroni et al, Commun Biol 2021).
